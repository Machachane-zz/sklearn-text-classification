# sklearn-text-classification
 
Sklearn text classification using the 20newsgroups dataset 

According to https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html

Algorithm: Multinomial Naive Bayes

Important concepts such as: 
train data, test data, 
TfidfVectorizer, vectorizer, vectors, transform
MultinomialNB, alpha, 
Numpy, asarray, get_feature_names(), argsort, coef 
accuracy, score, filenames, target, shape, 
classifier, fit, prediction, 
metrics, f1-score, average


Relevant actions:

1 - The real data lies in the filenames and target attributes. The target attribute is the integer index of the category.

2 - Loading only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the list of the categories to load to the sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups function.

3 - Converting text into vectors of numerical values suitable for statistical analysis.

4 - Filtering text for more realistic training. (It is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the 20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that arenâ€™t from this window of time.)
